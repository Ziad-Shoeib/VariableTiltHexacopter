## ROS Git Ignore (from ChatGPT)

# ================================================================
# ROS2 .gitignore
#
# This file excludes directories and files that are generated during
# the build process of a ROS2 workspace using colcon. Including these
# in version control is unnecessary and may lead to conflicts when
# switching between different development environments.
# ================================================================

# Directories generated by colcon build:
build/
install/
log/
logs/

# Auto-generated message and service code (if applicable):
msg_gen/
srv_gen/

# Python bytecode files:
*.pyc

# Files produced by dynamic reconfigure (if any are generated in your project):
*.cfgc

# Temporary files and backups:
*~
*.tmp
.#*

# IDE-specific files (e.g., Eclipse, Qt Creator, etc.):
.project
.cproject
CMakeLists.txt.user
*.user

# Optionally ignore residual configuration directories (custom or legacy):
/cfg/
